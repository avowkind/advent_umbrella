# Advent of Code Umbrella

This project contains all the Elixir code I used to complete [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023/).

Each day is a separate mix project in the apps folder. 

I strongly advise against using this code as an example of how to write Elixir:
* As the code is written under the clock it is often unfinished and undocumented
* while there are tests, I use them a lot to exercise the modules, they won't all pass as I may trash them while doing part 2
* I'm just starting to learn Elixir so this will not be either the best algorithm or use of style.

Cheers Andrew
